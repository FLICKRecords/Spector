# Spector
Acutek - Spector

Spector is my new single, which I have released onchain including rare artifacts as part of the release campaign.

In the music industry, people only share the final product (i.e., the music), never really the process behind it, why it was made, what inspired the song, or how the release is planned. Everyone keeps this to themselves, especially the marketing and release strategy, gatekeeping their approach. 

I didn't want to do this and went in the opposite direction, sharing all with the aim of building connections with those engaging with the content and educating along the journey for both people who are Web3 native and those who aren't, to show that release campaigns can be constructed outside of the perceived industry norm that everyone is advised on. 

This project is being built out with the purpose of building a world around a song. I've shared insights into the release strategy, promotional plans, the unedited raw base artwork file, admin decisions, the overall project vision, and other artifacts and videos. 

All parts of the collection have been minted on Zora, and the song itself has been released on Sound.xyz, all open edition free mint + protocol rewards to make it easily accessible and open to all throughout onchain summer at an affordable price. 

The final stage of the project is to build a case study and then present it in IRL sessions. The aim of this is to demonstrate that art, in any shape, size, or format can be distbuted in Web3 and encourage people to mint their work and experiment. The more success I can bring to the project, the more appealing the case study and sessions are. 

I'm aware this project has not been presented in the traditional sense but I still wanted to submit it to show Base what I'm building and how I'm trying to bring people onchain. 

This is the website I've built to show all items in the collection with public facing information about the project - https://www.bonfire.xyz/Acutek/spector
