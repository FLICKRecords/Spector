# Spector
Acutek - Spector

Spector is my new single which I have released onchain including rare artefacts as part of the release campaign.

In the music industry people only share the final product (ie: the music), never really the process behind it, why it was made, what inspired the song and how the release is planned. Everyone keeps this to themselves, especially the marketing and release strategy, gatekeeping their approach. 

I didn't want to to do and went the complete opposite direction to share all with the aim to build connection with those engaging with the content and educate along the journey for both people who are Web3 native but also those who aren't to show that release campaigns can be structed outside of the industry norm that's thrown down everyones necks. 

This project is being built out with the purpose of building a world around a song. I've shared insights into the release strategy, prommotional plans, the unedited raw base artwork file, admmin decision, the overall project vision amoungst other artefacts and videos. 

All parts of the collection have been minted on Zora and the song itself has been released on Sound.xyz, all open edition free mint + protocol rewards to make it easily accessible and open to all throughout onchain summer at an affordable price. 

The final stage of the project is to build a case study and then present it in IRL sessions. The aim of this is to demonstrate that art in any shape can be distbuted in Web3 and encourage people to mint their work and expermiment. The more sucess I can bring with the project makes the case study and sessions appealing. 

I'm aware this project has not been presented in the traditional sesnse but I still wanted to submit this to show Base what I'm building and how I'mm trying to bring people onchain. 

This is the website I'v e built to show all items in the collection with public facing information about the project - https://www.bonfire.xyz/Acutek/spector
