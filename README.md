# Spector
Acutek - Spector

Spector is my new single which I have released onchain including rare artefacts as part of the release campaign. 
In the music industry people only share the final product (ie: the music), never really the process behind it, why it was made, what inspired the song and how the release is planned. Everyone keeps this to themselves, especially the marketing and release strategy to gatekeep their approach. 

I didn't want to to do and went the complete opposite direction to share all with the aim to build connection with those engaging with the content and educate along the journey for both people who are Web3 native but also those who aren't to show that release campaigns can be structed outside of the industry norm that's thrown down everyones necks.
